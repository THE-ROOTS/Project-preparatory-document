### Project

A small CGI company was founded by two high-school friends who started out making videos on their phones. Now they employ a few more artists and a business manager. The two founders live together and their home has served as a de facto office, but the other employees usually work from home.

  - With the money from recent advertising jobs, they want to hire more artists and move into a real office where they will have the space to expand.
 
  - They want to move away from the BYOD method and start providing computers owned and managed by the company.
  
  - The artists are proficient and responsible Windows and Mac users, but lack any IT skills.
  
  - Artists work mostly on powerful Mac or Windows workstations, though they also have laptops used for lighter work and when filming.
  
  - Managing the many large video and graphics files has been a pain-point. With artists working from home, the stop-gap solution has been a poorly organized shelf of external and internal hard-drives used to move data to and from the founders' home.
  
  - They would like some kind of central data storage solution on site at their office.
  
  - They may want to make this central data storage solution accessible remotely in the future, but that is not a current need.
